# RISC-V and X86-64 Reference Card

An unofficial reference sheet for RISC-V, the free and libre ISA from Berkeley and also a suitably small and sane subset of X86-64. ([**PDF**][pdf]).  Derived from [https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card][https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card].  This is optimized for ECS 50 at UC Davis.

## What's inside?

- The base ISA (RV32I), with opcode values and C-like descriptions
- Standard ISA extensions (most but not all yet)
- Register aliases and calling conventions for RISC-V
- Pseudoinstructions
- x86 register aliases and calling conventions
